This add-on provides quick commands to manage objects on screen, including navigation and other possibilities.

## Commands

* Control+NVDA+TAB: Steps through arrow key modes (see below for details).

## Arrow key modes

The add-on provides four ways to use arrow keys:

* Classic (or normal mode): use arrow keys to move cursor.
* Object nav: use arrow keys to move to next/previous/parent/first child objects.
* Browse mode: use arrow keys to cycle through browse mode elements (web included) and move between them.

The following commands are available with arrow keys set to object nav:

* Right arrow: next object.
* Left arrow: previous object.
* Up arrow: parent object.
* Down arrow: first child object.
* SPACE or ENTER: activate.

* Right arrow: next element.
* Left arrow: previous element.
* Up arrow: previous element type.
* Down arrow: next element type.
* SPACE or ENTER: activate.
